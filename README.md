Official implementation of our approach for modelling the dynamic 3D world as a set of 3D Gaussians that move & rotate over time. This extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes, with accurate novel-view synthesis and dense 3D 6-DOF tracking.<br><br>

## Installation:
```bash
# Install this repo (pytorch)
git clone git@github.com:JonathonLuiten/Dynamic3DGaussians.git
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate dynamic_gaussians

# Install rendering code (cuda)
git clone git@github.com:JonathonLuiten/diff-gaussian-rasterization-w-depth.git
pip install -e diff-gaussian-rasterization-w-depth
```

## Run visualizer on pretrained models:
```bash
cd Dynamic3DGaussians
wget https://omnomnom.vision.rwth-aachen.de/data/Dynamic3DGaussians/output.zip  # Download pretrained models
unzip output.zip
python visualize.py  # See code for visualization options
```

## Train models yourself:
```bash
cd Dynamic3DGaussians
wget https://omnomnom.vision.rwth-aachen.de/data/Dynamic3DGaussians/data.zip  # Download training data
unzip data.zip
python train.py 
```

## Code Structure:
I tried really hard to make this code really clean and useful for building upon. In my opinion it is now much nicer than the original code it was built upon.
Everything is relatively 'functional' and I tried to remove redundant classes and modules wherever possible. 
Almost all of the code is in [train.py](./train.py) in a few core functions, with the overall training loop clearly laid out.
There are only a few other helper functions used, divided between [helpers.py](helpers.py) and [external.py](external.py) (depending on license).
I have split all useful variables into two dicts: 'params' (those updated with gradient descent), and 'variables' (those not updated by gradient descent).
There is also a custom visualization codebase build using Open3D (used for the cool visuals on the website) that is entirely in [visualize.py](visualize.py).
Please let me know if there is anyway you think the code could be cleaner. 


## Potential bugs:
This code works quite well and gives excellent results. However I have noted that sometimes it does give somewhat worse results compared to my older messy code, and perhaps this is because there may have been some bugs introduced in the cleanup process. 
I don't know exactly where or why the results are different (or even if they are different, maybe I was getting bad results randomly), and I don't have time to do a thorough investigation myself.
Releasing this code as-is now because many people have been asking for it, and maybe together we can figure this out.
I would love any help investigating this, and in general figure out anyway to improve this code and the results.
I am happy to share old code with people who want to explicitly find the differences, on the conditions that 
(a) it is only used for improving this code base, and (b) it is deleted and not built upon / used after.
This code is thus a work in progress.


## Differences to paper:
This codebase contains some significant changes from the results presented in the currently public version of the paper.
Both this codebase and the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09713.pdf) are work-in-progress and likely to change in the near future.
Until I find time to update the paper (eta December 1st) the code here is the more up-to-date public facing version of these two.

Differences:
 - In the paper we 'hard fixed' the colour to be perfectly consistent over time for each Gaussian by simply not updating it after the first timestep.
In this codebase the colour is only 'soft fixed'. e.g. it is updated over time, but there is a regularization loss added which 'soft enforces' it to be consistent over time.
 - Because we know the ground-plane of the scenes we are using a 'floor loss' to enforce Gassians don't go below the floor.

Please let me know if there are any other differences between the paper and the code so that I can include them here and remember to include them in future version of the paper.


## Partial code release:
So far we have released two parts of the code: training and visualization.
There are three further parts to be released in the future when I find time to clean them up (ETA Nov 1):
 - Evaluation code for evaluating the method for both novel-view-synthesis and tracking.
 - Data preparation code, to create the cleaned dataset (which I have provided), from the raw CMU panoptic capture data.
 - Code for creative editing of scenes (scene composition, etc).


## Calls for contributions: Let's make this code better together!
Happy to work together to make this code better. If you want to contrib either open and issue / pull request, or send me an email.

### Speeding up the code:
I do a number of dumb things which slows the code down ALOT. If someone is motivated improving these could significantly speed up training time.
 - To do the 'fg/bg' segmentation loss I am doing the full rendering process twice. By diving into the cuda a little, changing this could easily make training ~2x faster.
However, note that for full reproducibility maybe this should only be done after the first timestep, as in the first timestep the gradients from just the colour rendering are used for densification.
 - The current implementation of the local-rigidity loss in pytorch slows the code down MUCH more than it should. Currently it adds something like 20ms per training iter (e.g. 50 iter/s with, 100 without)
however I have a compiled jax version that is much faster only adding ~1ms which wouldn't really slow down training at all). Not sure how to speed this up in pure pytorch but there might be away. 
Other ideas include upgrading to pytorch 2.0 and using compile, writing this part in cuda, or somehow using jax here (or everywhere).
 - Lots of other parts of this pytorch code are not super efficient. Lots of room to make speedups.
 - Potentially the whole code could be ported to pure cuda. E.g. see [here](https://github.com/MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda).
 
### Visualization:
In this codebase we provide an open3D based dynamic visualizer. This is makes adding 3D effects (like the track trajectories) really easy, although it definitely makes visualization slower than it should be. 
E.g. the code renders the scene at 800 FPS, but including open3D in order to display it on the scene (and add camera controls etc) slows it down to ~30 FPS.

I have seen lots of cool renderers for Gaussians for static scenes. It would be cool to make my dynamic scenes work on these.

In particular, I have seen various things that (a) somehow run on my phone and old laptop (e.g. [here](https://gsplat.tech/) and [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cakewalk/splat)) (b) run on VR headsets (e.g. [here](https://twitter.com/charshenton/status/1704358063036375548) and [here](https://twitter.com/s1ddok/status/1696249177250931086)) (c) run in commonly used tools like unity (e.g. [here](https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting))

Dylan made a helpful list that can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanebert/list-of-splats)


## Further research:
There are ALOT of cool things still to be done building upon Dynamic 3D Gaussians. If you're doing so (especially research projects) feel free to reach out if you want to discuss (email / issue / twitter)

## Notes on license:
The code in this repository (except in external.py) is licensed under the MIT licence.

However, for this code to run it uses the cuda rasterizer code from [here](https://github.com/JonathonLuiten/diff-gaussian-rasterization-w-depth),
as well as various code in [external.py](./external.py) which has been taken or adapted from [here](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting).
These are required for this project, and for these a much more restrictive license from Inria applies which can be found [here](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
This requires express permission (licensing agreements) from Inria for use in any commercial application, but is otherwise freely freely distributed for research and experimentation.
